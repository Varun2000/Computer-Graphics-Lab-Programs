This repository contains the opengl programs which are done by Sai Venkata Varun Danda, 1RV17CS134.

Program 1
Write a program to generate a line using Bresenham’s line drawing technique. Consider slopes greater than one and slopes less than one. User must able to draw as many lines and specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

Program 2
Write a program to generate a circle and ellipse using Bresenham’s circle drawing and ellipse drawing techniques. Use two windows to draw circle in one window and ellipse in the other window. User can specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

Program 3
Write a program to recursively subdivides a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified at execution time.

Program 4
Write a program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling algorithm.
