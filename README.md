# Computer-Graphics-Lab-Programs 1RV17CS134

This repository contains the opengl programs which are done by Sai Venkata Varun Danda, 1RV17CS134.

Program 1

Write a program to generate a line using Bresenham’s line drawing technique. Consider slopes greater than one and slopes less than one. User must able to draw as many lines and specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

Program 2

Write a program to generate a circle and ellipse using Bresenham’s circle drawing and ellipse drawing techniques. Use two windows to draw circle in one window and ellipse in the other window. User can specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

Program 3

Write a program to recursively subdivides a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified at execution time.

Program 4

Write a program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling algorithm.

Program 5

Write a program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for
displaying the clipped image.

Program 6

Write a program to implement the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for displaying 
the clipped image.

Program 7

Write a program to implement the Cohen-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input polygon and window for clipping.

Program 8

Write a program to create a house like figure and reflect it about an axis defined by y=mx+c and rotate it about a given fixed point using OpenGL transformation functions.

Program 9

Write a program to model a car like figure using display lists.

Program 10

Write a program to create a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformations.

Program 11

Write a program to generate a Limacon, Cardiod, Three-Leaf, spiral.

Program 12

Write a program to construct Bezier curve. Control points are supplied through keyboard/mouse.
